- About passing json as promise:
  Lodaing the html page, 'new classTools.pageClass()' @./js/destination.js is executed synchronously.
  The class is istantiated immediately and 'this.jData = jData' variable passing jData as
  argument to the class constructor yelds to a "before assignement", that is, before the promise is fulfilled.
  There's no event handler related to the promise which could wait for the promise completion.
  
  --> Fix this making 'this.init()' method invoked by constructor async and await the promise data.
